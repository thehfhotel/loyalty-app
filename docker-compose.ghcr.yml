# GHCR Image Override
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# This file overrides the build: directives with image: directives to use pre-built
# images from GitHub Container Registry instead of building locally.
#
# When both 'build:' and 'image:' are specified, Docker Compose uses 'image:' for pulling
# and only builds if the image doesn't exist. With pre-built GHCR images, this works correctly.
#
# Environment variable IMAGE_TAG specifies the image tag (commit SHA or 'latest')
# Example: IMAGE_TAG=abc1234 docker compose -f ... up -d
